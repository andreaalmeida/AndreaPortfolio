		<h2>My role</h2>
		<p>Co-design lead</p>

		<h2>The design process</h2>
		<p>The Fooda tech team collaborated to created an Apple Watch extension in one week.  My role was to design it along-side
		another designer.  This was our first time designing for a watch, so we did some research to better
		understand how it works and how to deisgn for it.  We created the different looks, notification screens and graphics
		which were tied into the code by the developers.  The watch extension works in conjunction with the Fooda iOS app
		by notifying you if you havenâ€™t yet ordered lunch that day, and if you have, allowing you to track your order.
