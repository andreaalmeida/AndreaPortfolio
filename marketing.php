		<h2>My role</h2>
		<p>Design sprint facilitator</p>



		<h2>An introduction to design sprints</h2>
		<p>A design sprint is a 5-day process for answering critical business questions through design.  
			Each day has a distinct, specific focus, and consists of a number of exercises, which were led by the facilitator (me).  
			On day one we understood the problem, on day two we ideated on solutions, on day three we decided which solutions were 
			the best, on day four we prototyped those solutions, and on day five we tested our prototypes on actual users.</p>

		<!-- <p>i let this design spring based on google venture design sprint guidelines - 
			we wanted to create marketing material to help drive more client sales - aka more companies that want to partner 
			with fooda to offer food to their emplyees at lunch.  Was 5 days, we had a bunch of different people participate, 
			designers, marketing experts, sales team, product manager, CEO, COO.  Was great to get a bunch of different people 
			from different parts of the company to understand how everything functions within sales today, peoples goals, 
			where they are experiencing difficultite,s and try and spot where we can make impovements, and come with ideas as to the how.
			we ended up with a marketing edition book - print and pdf from that can be taken to initial sales meeting and left behind 
			to highlight our program and also help educate people that maybe weren’t able to make it to the sales meeting.
			whenever you work with other departments and different people you see how many differences in wways of thinking there are.  
			this process really brought us together, helped everyone to be on the same page, and helped to better understand the 
			problem and get to know each other better.
		</p> -->

		<h2>The design process</h2>
		<p>The Fooda marketing team needed marketing collateral and wanted to find out what kinds of collateral and what types 
			of messages would work the best for driving account sales for different types of services.  The sprint allowed us all 
			- stakeholders, marketing team, designers, content writers, and sales people - to be in the same room at the same time, 
			dive into the problem, understand where we should be focusing our efforts, ideate (a lot) on the problem, create prototypes 
			of marketing material, and then test these prototypes on actual users.  All this was done in a 5-day span, and at the end of 
			it, we came out with answers about which marketing efforts work where, and which don’t. We ended this sprint having designed
			a 
			Fooda education book that the sales team can bring to meetings with potential new clients.</p>
