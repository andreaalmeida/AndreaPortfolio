		<h2>What I do</h2>
		<p>UX & UI Design, Front-end development, photography</p>

		<h2>Who I am</h2>
		<p>I am an artist, a thinker, a doer, who loves to make connections to better understand the world around me.  I'm a perfectionist by nature but I value rapid crude iterations.  I don't like to do what has already been done.  I need to create things that are unique, different, better. I fail a lot.  I go through hundreds of different ideas until I land on the best solution.  Sometimes it was the first idea that came to mind, but I needed to go through the other 99 ideas to make sure of that.  I crave meaning in life, in everything that I do and experience.  I love to create solutions that dazzle aesthetically but also make someone's task simple and more enjoyable.  I'm a great listener, and I love to observe. I look for beauty in everything.  Running is my outlet.  It's where I reconnect with myself and my surroundings.  It's my time to shut off my brain, to recharge, to be completely free, and choose the direction I want to go.  But that is life right?  We pick the path we want to follow.  For me that path is design.</p>
