		<h2>My role</h2>
		<p>Design Lead</p>

		<h2>The design process</h2>
		<p>This project was all about creating a wonderful mobile experience for Fooda's customers.  Fooda delivers restaurant food to people at work,
			The app is a new easy way for users to quickly see daily menus and place an order for delivery.  The design phase of this project
			lasted about 3 months.  I worked closely with business stakeholders to understand business needs, talked to users about
			there needs.  The first step int he design process was nailing down the user story.  How to they flow through the app?
			What are all the different use cases?  What if someone alrady has an existing account?  What if a user has more than one account?
			These were all things I needed to incorporate into the design of the app, while optimizing the experience for the majority of users.
			What I learned when working with others in the business.  Everyone has an opinion.  And you need to come prepared to fight
			for your decisions.  It was definily a leanrning experience.  The new app launched in 2015.  As it was being created by the
			developers, I worked closely with them to make sure that the design matched the initial mock-ups.  Due to time constraints to get
			something out the door, scope was cut in a few different places, so this first release didn't end up being as robust as the original
			design.
