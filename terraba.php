		<h2>My role</h2>
		<p>Design lead, front-end developer, and photographer</p>

		<h2>The client</h2>
		<p>The Terribe are an indigenous tribe living in the Puntarenas region of Costa Rica. They sustain themselves through growing 
			their own food and
		also continue to follow many ancient 
		traditions of their ancestors.  In recent years, it's been difficult for them to support 
		a lifestyle with modern conveniences such as electricity and internet. To help with these costs, the tribe began inviting
		tourists to stay with them for days or weeks at a time, making for a completely emmersive cultural experience.
		</p>

		<h2>The design process</h2>
		<p>I traveled to Costa Rica with a team of 7 others to meet the Terribe tribe and learn about their culture.
			Our goal was to create a website for them that would help to market their tourism business.  We spent about 10
			days with them, participating in their daily routines, getting to know their ancient customs, and documenting it all 
			along the way.  When we returned from the trip, we worked together to design and build a custom website for them in under two 
			weeks.
